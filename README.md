## About The Project

This Project was an assignment for University. The application allows one to create, edit and delete heritage sites.
The data for the heritage sites is saved in a .csv file and was provided by [opendatasoft.com](https://opendatasoft.com).
The user interface supports multi language (english and german) and has a custom dark theme.
This project also allows one to track the heritage sites one has visited around the world by simply checking them of the list.
